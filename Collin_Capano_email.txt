Hi Hunter,

I’m also very interested in this. Your PP plots also seem to diverge much more
than the tests we’ve done. In addition to the result Alex referenced in the
PyCBC Inference paper, Sumit has also done PP tests using Dynesty and CPNest
since we’ve implemented them, and they seem to do better than in Fig. 4. What
sort of p-values do you get if you do a KS test on the p-p plots? For a more
apples-to-apples comparison, I can send you the injection sets we used if you
like.

Also, quick style note: in the first couple of pages your refer to your
algorithm as CVAE, whereas in the second half of the paper it’s called VItamin.
These are the same thing right? I’m guessing this was the merging of two
different versions?

Anyway, very cool results!

Best,
Collin
