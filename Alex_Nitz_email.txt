Hunter,

I'm interested in your recently published paper. The results seem very
promising. 

One thing that caught my eye was the p-p plot. You are getting similar results
as some other samples, however, none of them seem to be doing well. Do you have
any idea what is going on here? Given the consistency between the different
samplers you tried, is it possible you simply aren't drawing your test samples
from your prior? You can test if the curve is deviating from the diagonal by
the expected amount by doing a KS test . 

If you compare to the plots in the pycbc inference paper, it seems to show
significantly more deviation than what we see even for samplers which have
*not* converged properly. Take for instance figure 3. Given you have more
samples (256 vs 100), I would expect less deviation from the diagonal.

On another note, we have a student who will be starting graduate school next
month and is very interested in machine learning. He's been doing his masters
working towards BNS detections with CNNs. Would you be open to having a call at
some point to go over some of your results? I think we'd be interested in
taking a further look into the kind of network you've put together.
